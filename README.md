## Description
The Note Taker application is an Express.js-based web application that allows users to write, save, and retrieve notes from a simple JSON file storage system. This application serves as a convenient way to keep track of tasks, appointments, or any other information that needs to be noted down and accessed later.

* **Motivation:** Developed to demonstrate the integration of a front-end user interface with a back-end server using Express.js, providing a practical example of full-stack development.
* **Purpose:** To offer a simple and intuitive platform for users to manage their notes, enhancing personal organization and productivity.
* **Problem It Solves:** It eliminates the hassle of manually managing notes across different mediums by centralizing note-taking in a single, accessible web application.
* **What I Learned:** Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Express.js and deploying a full-stack application to Heroku.

## Project Background
Initiated as a part of coursework for a Fullstack Coding Bootcamp, the Note Taker application embodies the application of back-end server creation with Express.js, coupled with front-end interactions. The project uses bootcamp-provided starter code as its foundation, which I expanded upon to include functionality for note management.

## Installation 
To install and run the Note Taker application locally:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ktotah/ktotah-note-taker.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running: `npm install` in your terminal.

## Usage 
After installation, start the server by running `node server.js` in your terminal. Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Note Taker application. You can then add and view notes.

## Deployment
The Note Taker application is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed at [Heroku App URL](https://ktotah-note-taker-441438026038.herokuapp.com/). This deployment demonstrates the application running in a production environment.
